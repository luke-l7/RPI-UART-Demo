# RPI-UART_-Demo
Communicating over the UART_ with the Raspberry Pi
## Getting Started

In this tutorial I will be creating a demo for using the UART_ on the Raspberry pi 4, I'm going to be using the RPI 4B model, but any model should be fine as well. </br>

### Step one - Activating the serial communication





* add a little about the mini UART_
* add steps and explanation to activating the UART_ on the RPI

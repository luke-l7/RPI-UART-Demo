# RPI-UART-Demo
Communicating over the UART_ with the Raspberry Pi
## Getting Started

In this tutorial I will be creating a demo for using the UART_ on the Raspberry pi 4, I'm going to be using the RPI 4B model, but any model should be fine as well. </br>

### Step one - Activating the serial communication

1. Open up your PI terminal.
2. Enter the command *sudo raspi-config*.
3. Use your arrow keys to navigate to *Advanced options*, and press enter.
4. Navigate to the *Serial* option.

At this point, the terminal will ask if you want a login shell activated, in case you do, press yes.
Another prompt will pop up asking if you want the Serial Port activated, to that you should select **yes**, and then **reboot**.

* add a little about the mini UART_
* add steps and explanation to activating the UART_ on the RPI
